# Batch-Files
Some of the Batch Files I've Made, Enjoy!

### Intro
hey, these are some batch files i made in my free time, they are quite frankly dumb and impractical.
but you can use them if you want...
**This Repository** is more of a place to store some of my projects, rather than work on them.

#### **_However!_**
if you wish to edit/fix/improve or whatever some code, please feel free to in a seperate branch.

### Why Every File is a Folder with 2 Files Inside (and the 2nd one isnt batch)
yeah... this is gonna be either really good for you, really annoying for you or you are not gonna care.
each batch file that does something is inside a folder called:
> <*Batch File Name*>
and **Inside** that folder is (most likely) 1 file called:
> <*Batch File Name*>.bat
and 1 file called:
> <*Batch File Name*> Explination.md
