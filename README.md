# Batch-File
--------

### Intro
hey, these are some batch files I made in my free time, they are quite frankly dumb and impractical.
but you can use them if you want...
**This Repository** is more of a place to store some of my projects, rather than work on them.

#### **_However!_**
if you wish to edit/fix/improve or whatever some code, please feel free to in a separate branch.
If you want to ask questions then there is a folder called `Questions` that you can ask and answer questions in.

### Why Every File is a Folder with 2 Files Inside (and the 2nd one isn't batch)
yeah... this is gonna be either really good for you, really annoying for you or you are not gonna care.
each batch file that does something is inside a folder called:
`<*Batch File Name*>`
and **Inside** that folder is (most likely) 1 file called:
`<*Batch File Name*>.bat`
and 1 file called:
`<*Batch File Name*> Explination.md`

### Y tho?
Because, if you are learning batch for some reason (unprofessional I presume [cuz u r here])
you can look at the explanation of the code and learn what it does or just read the code.
IDK, whatever you want.

### If You are Writing/Editing
The thing is... the code needs to run off of a standard windows 10 computer with no
files or folders that are not standard, meaning the code must produce it.

### If you Really Need Extra Files/Folders to Make it.
If you NEED extra files/folder then that is ok, but not preferred.
add the prefix `Extra-` to the file name and the explanation file, so:
`Extra-<*Batch File Name*>.bat`
and:
`Extra-<*Batch File Name*> Explination.md`

#### AND
IF POSSIBLE add a separate file (2 counting the Explanation.md file), named as per normal.
this file is not needed, but sorta really, really, really, wanted.
This file will contain a version of the same code in the folder... but it will be modified
so that it will run on the standard windows 10 computer that has no extra files/folders.

### Questions
If you have any questions there is a folder called
`Questions`
that surprisingly is meant for questions!!!!!

#### New Questions
If you have any NEW QUESTIONS (not a file named the topic) make another `.md` file 
name the file whatever your questions topic is, make the topic broad, but not too broad so:
`<*Question Topic*>.md`

#### Question that has a `.md` with Topic
if there is a `.md` file that fits your topic:
- See if there is a question INSIDE the `.md` that is the same/answers your question.
- Add Your Question Using the format below.

### New Question Format
Within the appropriot `.md` question file use this format.
`Q: <*Question *>     [[<*Profile Name*>]]
A: `

###Answering Questions
Answering Questions is very important cause... some people have questions. If you want to answer questions, use this format:
`Q: <*Question*>     [[<*Profile Name*>]]
A: <*Answer*>         [[<*Profile Name*>]]`

#### Thank You
